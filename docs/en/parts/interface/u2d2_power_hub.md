## [Description](#description)

1. **DYNAMIXEL Connectors**: 3 and 4-pins JST connectors are installed for communication. See [Connector Information](#connector-information) for more details.

2. **TTL/RS485 Test Points**: TTL data line, RS485 D +, D-line signals can be easily identified via the test points

3. **Power Connectors**: U2D2 PHB provides three different types of power connectors to supply a diverse voltage and current to DYNAMIXEL. 
    - SMPS DC Connector (2.5mm ID / 5.5mm OD, [Center Positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity_symbols))
    - MOLEX Power connector (See [Connector Information](#connector-information) for more details)
    - PCB Screw Terminal Block Connector

**CAUTION**: 
- Be sure to check the polarity of the terminal block connector when using an external power supply, to enhance the user safety.
- Some pins stick out on the bottom of the board, which are prone to touch the floor. To prevent from touching a floor, assemble the board with the supplied supporters following [How to Assemble](#how-to-assemble) instruction.

6. Connect power to `U2D2 Power Hub Board`.

    **DANGER** : Do NOT use multiple power inputs at the same time. Select ONLY one of the power source to connect.
    {: .notice--danger}

    **WARNING** : Check the Recommended Voltage for DYNAMIXEL before supplying the power.
