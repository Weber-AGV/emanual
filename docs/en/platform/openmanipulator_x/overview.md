ROS compatible OpenMANIPULATOR-X (RM-X52-TNM) is a robot platform consisting of **Open Source Software**​, **Open Source Hardware** and is compatible with **OpenCR(Embedded controller)​**.

## [Open Source Software](#open-source-software)
OpenMANIPULATOR-X supports ROS. The official ROS platform TurtleBot series has been supporting "TurtleBot Arm". The OpenMANIPULATOR-X is fullly compatibile with TurtleBot3​. Users can easily control it through the `MoveIt!` ROS package. Even if you do not have an actual robot, you can control the robot in the Gazebo simulator​. 

## [Open Source Hardware](#open-source-hardware)
OpenMANIPULATOR-X (RM-X52-TNM) is an open source hardware oriented platform​. Most of the components are uploaded as [STL files](http://www.robotis.com/service/download.php?no=690) so that users can easily create them using a 3D printer. It also allows users to modify the length of the links or the design of the robot for their own purposes. OpenMANIPULATOR-X (RM-X52-TNM) is made of **DYNAMIXEL-X ​Series** which is used in TurtleBot3.

- If you want to develop on an embedded system, prepare [OpenCR](http://en.robotis.com/shop_en/item.php?it_id=903-0257-000) and PC. 
- In order to run with ROS, prepare your PC and either the [DYNAMIXEL Starter Set](http://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-starter-set/?_ga=2.61621164.1048223353.1594349518-2121469020.1594349518) or [OpenCR](http://en.robotis.com/shop_en/item.php?it_id=903-0257-000).  

## [OpenCR (Embedded board)](#opencr-embedded-board)
OpenMANIPULATOR-X RM-X52-TNM can also be controlled using [OpenCR] (Open-source Control module for ROS), the control board used in TurtleBot3. The computing power and real-time controllability of OpenCR can support forward and inverse kinematics, and [profile control](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xm430-w350/#profile-acceleration108) examples. 

## [DYNAMIXEL Examples](#dynamixel-examples)

OpenMANIPULATOR-X RM-X52-TNM is composed of [DYNAMIXEL-X series](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xm430-w350/) and [3D printing parts](http://www.robotis.com/service/download.php?no=767). DYNAMIXEL has a modular form and adopts the daisy chain method. It allows users to easily add or remove joints for their own use. Taking advantage of this characteristic, users can build seven different types of OpenMANIPULATOR-X series : Chain, SCARA, Link, Planar, Delta, Stewart and Linear.
