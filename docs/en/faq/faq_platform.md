No, the OpenMANIPULATOR-P frame set is not sold separately.

## What is the specifications of the OpenMANIPULATOR-P?

The OpenMANIPULATOR's specifications are available on the [platform's eManual page](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_p/specification/#specifications).

## What is the power requirement for the OpenMANIPULATOR-P?

The OpenMANIPULATOR-P consumes 15~30A at DC 24V. It consumes less than 2A during idle status.

## Is an end effector or gripper included with the OpenMANIPULATOR-P

No, a gripper is not included. The [Robot Hand]( /docs/en/platform/rh_p12_rna/ ) gripper is the recommended option for this platform.

## Where can I find base plate component setup information?

Please refer to [here](http://en.robotis.com/model/search.php?sfl=wr_subject%7C%7Cwr_content&sop=and&stx=base+plate&x=2&y=9) for the Manipulator Base Plate. We have 2 types of plates which are [Base Plate-01](http://en.robotis.com/shop_en/item.php?it_id=905-0019-000) and [Base Plate-02](http://en.robotis.com/shop_en/item.php?it_id=905-0026-000).

## Is OpenMANIPULATOR available examples, and some helpful information?

All [technical specifications](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/specification/#specification), configuration examples, and [open-source CAD](http://en.robotis.com/service/downloadpage.php?ca_id=70g0) for the OpenMANIPULATOR are available online in the ROBOTIS e-Manual entry for the [OpenMANIPULATOR platform](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/overview/).

ROBOTIS also offers the [DYNAMIXEL SDK] a collection of open-source libraries for DYNAMIXEL control.

## What controller is required to operate an OpenMANIPULATOR?

OpenMANIPULATOR may be controlled using ROBOTIS controller boards such as the [OpenCR1.0](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/#introduction), from a computer using a [U2D2](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/interface/u2d2/#introduction) USB-serial converter, or from third-party controllers capable of TTL or RS485 communications.
