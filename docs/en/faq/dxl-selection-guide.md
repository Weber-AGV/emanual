# [Getting Started](#getting-started)

When selecting a DYNAMIXEL servo and control solution for your application, it is important to ensure that all of your chosen components are compatible with one another. One way to ensure that they will all be compatible with one another is to select them in the following order.  

- [DYNAMIXEL](#dynamixel)
- [Power](#power)
- [Controller & Interface](#controller--interface)
- [Software & Tools](#software--tools)

Each of these components is vital, and your choice for each will be dictated by the needs of your application, as well as your previous choices. It is important to consider all of the factors before you begin building your DYNAMIXEL, as well as during the selection process, so that you can ensure that all your choices are compatible.  

The remainder of this document will provide a helpful guide to assist you in selecting the DYNAMIXEL Smart servo and control solution perfect for your use case.

# [DYNAMIXEL](#dynamixel)

The first consideration for any DYNAMIXEL System is the actuator. Choosing a DYNAMIXEL for your application should start by understanding the capabilities and communication protocols supported by the actuator you are considering. 

## [Models](#models)

DYNAMIXELs come in a variety of sizes and with a variety of capabilities, with each model especially suited for a particular purpose. Before we look into the specifics of DYNAMIXEL performance, it is helpful to understand the differences between each DYNAMIXEL model. 

![](/assets/images/dxl/x/dxl_x_productline.png)
> DYNAMIXEL-X Series Naming Convention

![](/assets/images/dxl/p/dynamixel_pro_plus_lineup_table.jpg)
> DYNAMIXEL-P Series Naming Convention

This information is invaluable in narrowing your choices for actuators before moving on to considering the performance of the units.

**NOTE**: DYNAMIXEL AX, MX series does not follow the naming convention, please jump to [Performance](#performance).
{: .notice}

## [Performance](#performance)

The easiest way to select a DYNAMIXEL based on its performance is to look at the N-T graph:

![](/assets/images/dxl/pro/h54-100-s500-r_performance_graph_2.jpg)
> Performance Graph (N-T graph)

<!-- {% include en/dxl/note_performance_graph.md %} -->

Most DYNAMIXEL servos have a graph like that one located on their page here on the e-Manual. This graph provides an easy way to examine the overall performance characteristics of the servo at a glance, by graphing four of the most important metrics against one another:

**NOTE**: In selecting DYNAMIXEL in terms of torque, ~20% of **Stall Torque** (See Specification) of DYNAMIXEL will be the general range of use for your system. 
{: .notice}

1. **Torque(Nm)** - External load applied at the shaft of servo. By the Torque(Nm), Output Speed(A) and Current(A) are determined

2. **Speed(RPM)** - The output speed at the Torque. This shares the **black** line. 

3. **Current(A)** - The amount of current drawn at the Torque. Represented by the <span style="color:red">**red**</span> line.

4. **Efficiency(%)** - The output efficiency considering with a DC motor and its gearset. Different motors and gearset will perform more or less efficiently at different speeds and loads. This is represented by the <span style="color:green">**green**</span> line.

These factors can help you compare the performance of different DYNAMIXELs to help you find the one that is right for your use case.

## [Communication](#communication)

Each DYNAMIXEL supports one of two serial communications: [TTL](#ttl), [RS-485](#rs-485). 

To communicate with DYNAMIXELs using a controller, the same communication interface(TTL or RS-485) must be used.

<details>
<summary>
![](/assets/images/icon_unfold.png) **Tip**: **Looking for a solution to combining TTL and RS-485 of DYNAMIXEL in your system ?**
</summary>
Ordinarily, DYNAMIXELs utilizing different serial protocols can not communicate with one another over the same serial bus. This means that it is important to select servos using compatible communications protocols. In some applications, you may need to combine DYNAMIXELs with mismatched serial protocols. For these cases, you can combine mismatched serial protocols using a [DYNAMIXEL Communication Bridge](/docs/en/parts/interface/dxl_bridge/).

![](/assets/images/parts/interface/dxl_bridge/u2d2_bridge_ttl_485.png)

</details>

### [TTL](#ttl)

TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic), 0 to 5V logic level, is the common serial communication interface of DYNAMIXEL. 

An easy way to identify TTL DYNAMIXEL actuator is that the model name ends with a "-T" (e.g, XL330-M288-**T**) and has three pins ports.

> Pin Diagram for TTL Based DYNAMIXEL, using JST connectors

<details>
<summary>
![](/assets/images/icon_unfold.png) **Tip**: **Communication Circuit of TTL based DYNAMIXEL**
</summary>
To control the DYNAMIXEL actuators, the main controller needs to convert its UART signals to the half duplex type. The recommended circuit diagram for this is shown below.  
![](/assets/images/dxl/ttl_circuit.png)  

**NOTE**: Above circuit is designed for 5V or 5V tolerant MCU. Otherwise, use a Level Shifter to match the voltage of MCU.
{: .notice}  

**NOTE**: 3.3V logic DYNAMIXELs, such as XL330 series, is 5V tolerant at data line. 
{: .notice}  
</details>

### [RS-485](#rs-485)

Some higher end DYNAMIXEL servos operate using RS-485 communications protocol. If you need longer cabling distance, RS-485 will the best option for you. 

An easy way to identify RS-485 based DYNAMIXEL actuator is that the model name ends with a "-R" (e.g, XD40-T150-**R**) and has four pins ports.

**NOTE**: Above circuit is designed for 5V or 5V tolerant MCU. Otherwise, use a Level Shifter to match the voltage of MCU.

</details>

# [Power](#power)

Supplying your DYNAMIXELs with adequate power is important to ensure proper function of your DYNAMIXEL System. DYNAMIXELs can be powered in a variety of ways, depending on the needs of the DYNAMIXEL and your project.

**NOTE**: For allowable current to a daisy chain of DYNAMIXELs in your system, visit your product e-Manual and see the **Connector Information** (e.g,[XD540-T150 Connector Information](/docs/en/dxl/x/xd540-t150/#connector-information))  
Note that used connector may differ depending on your selection.
{: .notice}

## [Operating Voltage](#operating-voltage)

Before selecting your power solution, check out the operating voltage for each DYNAMIXEL Model.

### [DYNAMIXEL-X](#dynamixel-x)

Operating Voltage may differ depending on what model to be selected. See the following table.   

| Symbol |             Operating Voltage             |              Recommended              |
|:------:|:-----------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
|   M    |                 3.7 ~ 6.0                 |                **5.0**                |
| T / W  | 10.0 ~ 14.8<br>(Max 12V for XL430, XC330) | **12.0** <br>(11.1V for XL430, XC330) |
| H / V  |                   24.0                    |               **24.0V**               |

**NOTE**: The **_Symbol_** in the table follows our [Naming Convention](#models) of DYNAMIXEL-X series only. For other DYNAMIXEL family's operating voltage, such as AX, MX, please visit [DYNAMIXEL.com](http://www.dynamixel.com/list.php?dxl=x) and find it at **Voltage** cell in a table.
