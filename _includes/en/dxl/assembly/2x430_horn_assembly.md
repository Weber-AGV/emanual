**CAUTION**: To ensure correct DYNAMIXEL-X series cable assembly untangle the DYNAMIXEL cable prior to insertion through the hollow shaft. Do not assemble the back case with a tangled cable, tangled cables may be crushed by the case and cause communication errors or damage to your DYNAMIXEL hardware.
