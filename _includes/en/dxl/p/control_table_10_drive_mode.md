The Drive Mode control table register allows the configuration of several settings related to the movement of your DYNAMIXEL actuator:

* Torque on by Goal Update allows the configuration of automatically enabling torque when an instruction packet is recieved by your actuator.
* Profile configuration is used to select a time based or velocity based movement profile setting.
* Normal/Reverse mode allows the configuration of the movement direction of your DYNAMIXEL.
