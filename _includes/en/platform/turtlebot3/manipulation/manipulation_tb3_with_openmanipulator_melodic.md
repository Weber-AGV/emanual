The OpenMANIPULATOR-X by ROBOTIS is one of the manipulators that support ROS, and has the advantage of being able to easily manufacture at a low cost by using DYNAMIXEL actuators with 3D printed parts.

The OpenMANIPULATOR-X has the advantage of being compatible with TurtleBot3 Waffle and Waffle Pi. Through this compatibility can compensate for the lack of freedom and can have greater completeness as a service robot with the the SLAM and Navigation capabilities that the TurtleBot3 has. TurtleBot3 and OpenMANIPULATOR-X can be used as a `mobile manipulator` and can do things like the following videos.
