</summary>
In case you use Intel Joule 570x, please follow the instructions below.  
Intel Joule is discontinued in 2017, and additional support is unavailable.

1. Download Ubuntu 16.04 image for Intel® Joule™  
  - [Download Ubuntu 16.04 for Intel® Joule™](http://people.canonical.com/~platform/snappy/tuchuck/desktop-final/tuchuck-xenial-desktop-iso-20170317-0.iso)

2. Create a bootable USB with the downloaded image.
3. Install Ubuntu from the USB
</details>

### Boot Up the Raspberry Pi
1. Connect the HDMI cable of the monitor to the HDMI port of Raspberry Pi.
2. Connect input devices to the USB port of Raspberry Pi
3. Insert the microSD card.
4. Connect the power (either with USB or OpenCR) to turn on the Raspberry Pi.

### Configure the Raspberry Pi

{% include en/platform/turtlebot3/ros_gpg_key_expiration_incident.md %}

1. After Raspbian OS is up and running, connect to the WiFi network that is connected with the PC.
2. Find the assigned IP address for Raspberry Pi with the command below. Usually wireless IP address for Raspberry Pi can be found under the `wlan0` section.
  ```bash
$ ifconfig
  ```
3. From your PC, open the terminal and connect to the Raspberry Pi with its IP address.  
  The default password is set as **turtlebot**.  
  ```bash
$ ssh pi@{IP_ADDRESS_OF_RASPBERRY_PI}
  ```
4. Once logged in to the Raspberry Pi, execute the commands below to sync time.  
  ```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ntpdate
$ sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com
  ```
5. Load Raspberry Pi configuration interface.
  ```bash
$ sudo raspi-config
  ```
6. Select `Advanced Options` > `Expand Filesystem` and exit.
7. Network configuration for ROS
  ```bash
$ nano ~/.bashrc
  ```
8. Go to the end of file with `Ctrl`+`END` or `Alt`+`/`, then modify the IP adddresses of `ROS_MASTER_URI` and the `ROS_HOSTNAME`.
  ```bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://{IP_ADDRESS_OF_REMOTE_PC}:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME={IP_ADDRESS_OF_RASPBERRY_PI_3}
  ```
9. Save the file and exit the nano editor.
10. Apply changes with the command below.
  ```bash
$ source ~/.bashrc
  ```

### NEW LDS-02 Configuration  
The TurtleBot3 LDS has been updated to LDS-02 since 2022 models.  
Please follow the instructions below on the **SBC (Raspberry Pi)** of TurtleBot3.  

|LDS-01|LDS-02|
|:---:|:---:|
|![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_lds/lds_small.png)|![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_lds/lds_ld08_small.png)|

1. Install the LDS-02 driver and update TurtleBot3 package.  
  ```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install libudev-dev
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone -b develop https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/ld08_driver.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3 && git pull
$ rm -r turtlebot3_description/ turtlebot3_teleop/ turtlebot3_navigation/ turtlebot3_slam/ turtlebot3_example/
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
  ```

2. Export the LDS_MODEL to the bashrc file. Depending on your LDS model, use `LDS-01` or `LDS-02`.  
  ```bash
$ echo 'export LDS_MODEL=LDS-02' >> ~/.bashrc
  ```

3. Apply changes with the command below.
  ```bash
