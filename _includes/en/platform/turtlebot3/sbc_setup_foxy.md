### ROS2 Network Configuration
In ROS2 DDS communication, `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` must be matched between **Remote PC** and **TurtleBot3** for communication under the same network environment.  
The default ROS Domain ID for TurtleBot3 is set to `30` in the ***.bashrc*** file.  
Please modify the ID to avoid any conflict when there are identical ID in the same network.

```
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30 #TURTLEBOT3
```

**WARNING** : Do not use an identical ROS_DOMAIN_ID with others in the same network. It will cause a conflict of communication between users under the same network environment.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/setup/ros2_sbc_netcfg.png)  
  Save the file with `Ctrl`+`S` and exit with `Ctrl`+`X`.

9. Reboot the Raspberry Pi.
  ```bash
$ sudo reboot
  ```

10. Set the `systemd` to prevent boot-up delay even if there is no network at startup. Run the command below to set mask the `systemd` process using the following command.
```bash
$ systemctl mask systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
```

11. Disable Suspend and Hibernation
  ```bash
$ sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
  ```

12. After rebooting the Raspberry Pi, if you wish to work from the Remote PC using SSH, use below command from the remote PC terminal. Make sure to use the password you set in `Step 5`.
  ```bash
$ ssh ubuntu@{IP Address of Raspberry PI}
  ```

13. Install ROS2 Foxy Fiztroy  
Enter below commands to the Raspberry Pi terminal one at a time.  
In order to check the details of the easy installation script, please refer to [the script file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/robotis_tools/master/install_ros2_foxy_rpi.sh).

$ sudo udevadm trigger
```

16. ROS Domain ID Setting
In ROS2 DDS communication, `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` must be matched between **Remote PC** and **TurtleBot3** for communication under the same network environment. Following commands shows how to assign a `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` to SBC in TurtleBot3.
- A default ID of **TurtleBot3** is `30`.  
- Configuring the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` of Remote PC and SBC in TurtleBot3 to `30` is recommended.  

```bash
$ echo 'export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30 #TURTLEBOT3' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

**WARNING** : Do not use an identical ROS_DOMAIN_ID with others in the same network. It will cause a conflict of communication between users under the same network environment.
{: .notice--warning}
